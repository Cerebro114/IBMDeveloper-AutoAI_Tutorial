# IBM-Developer---Code-Tutorial

# Introduction
It was inevitable to expect artificial intelligence, which facilitates every aspect of our lives, to facilitate its own development process. Building better models requires more complex, time-intensive and costly AI development process, which requires expertise from cleansing the data to feature engineering, designing the architectures to parameter optimization. In order to ease this process and make it efficient in terms of time and effort, we need to automate these workloads. With the aim of creating AI for AI, IBM introduced the new service on Watson Studio called, AutoAI.

AutoAI is a service which automates machine learning tasks so that it eases the tasks of data scientists. It automatically prepares your data for the modeling, makes feature engineering on it, chooses the best algorithm for your problem and creates pipelines for the trained models.


# Learning Objectives

In this tutorial, the aim is to show the benefits of this service on a use case so that we can have a better understanding of how regression and classification problem can be handled without any code and how the tasks, hyper-parameter optimizations feature extraction, are done with this service. Then, the tutorial will include the details of how to choose the best model among the pipelines and how to deploy and use these models.
