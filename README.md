# IBM-Developer---Code-Tutorial

# Introduction
It was inevitable to expect artificial intelligence, which facilitates every aspect of our lives, to facilitate its own development process. Building better models requires more complex, time-intensive and costly AI development process, which requires expertise from cleansing the data to feature engineering, designing the architectures to parameter optimization. In order to ease this process and make it efficient in terms of time and effort, we need to automate these workloads. With this aim, IBM introduced the new service on Watson Studio called, AutoAI.


# Learning Objectives
In this tutorial, the aim is to show the benefits of this service on a use case so that we can have a better understanding of how regression and classification problem can be handled without any code and how the tasks, hyper-parameter optimizations feature extraction, are done with this service. Then, the tutorial will include the details of how to choose the best model among the pipelines and how to deploy and use these models.
